        </div>  
        <div class="item4"><p>We believe each of our pooch and kitty guests’ has their own personality and preference,
            and therefore we treat them just like that, as individuals.
           For example, guests who are too overwhelmed with the dryer will be towel dried.
            Our aim is for our VIP’s to return having had a positive experience and joyful spa experience.
             A little run around in the shop is also allowed for pooches who have a fear of cages.
           We run our spa just as any human beauty salon would, 
           with each pet being scheduled in for a specific time slot so that minimal time is spent in the cages,
            thus minimising disruption and unsettling of any of our other furry guests..
           Kwanele, owner of the spa has achieved her groomers qualification from the Professional Academy of Dog Groomers.
            All staff are trained on an on-going basis to ensure the best and most fashionable 
            styling and to constantly improve their animal handling approach.
